Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1.
Position of set bit "1" should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.


                Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
                int n = sc.nextInt();
                int k = sc.nextInt();
                int bitmask = 1<<k;
                int ans = bitmask & n;
                if(ans == 0){
                        System.out.print("NO");
                }
                else
                        System.out.print("YES");
