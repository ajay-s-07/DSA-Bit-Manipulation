Given an integer N and an integer D, rotate the binary representation of the integer N by D digits to the left as well as right and print the results in decimal
values after each of the rotation. 
Note: Integer N is stored using 16 bits. i.e. 12 will be stored as 0000.....001100.


                Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
                int n = sc.nextInt();
                int d = sc.nextInt();
                int nbits = 16;
                int left = (n<<d) | (n >> (nbits-d)) & 0xFFFF;
                System.out.print(left + " ");
                int right = (n>>d) | (n<< (nbits-d)) & 0xFFFF;
                System.out.print(right);
